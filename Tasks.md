## Things to do

# Project Goals
- [] build A matrix in parallel -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15997888/creating-identity-matrix-with-cuda
- [] CUDA Library to calculate eigenvalues from a large (sparse) Matrix?
- [] Perform efficient matrix/vector multiplications
- [] Perform some type of timing analysis to quantify our speed up and show the utility of parallelization.

# Reach Goals

- [] figure out how to hook gnuPlot (or similar) into our program to automatically generate XY plots of matrix spectra
