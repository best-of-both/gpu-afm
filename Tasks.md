## Things to do

# Project Goals
1) build A matrix in parallel
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15997888/creating-identity-matrix-with-cuda
2) CUDA Library to calculate eigenvalues from a large (sparse) Matrix?
3) Perform efficient matrix/vector multiplications
4) Perform some type of timing analysis to quantify our speed up and show the utility of parallelization.

# Reach Goals

1) figure out how to hook gnuPlot (or similar) into our program to automatically generate XY plots of matrix spectra
